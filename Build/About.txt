Face Recognition Project

This project aims to provide a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV. It uses the Haar cascade classifier to detect human faces in live video feed from a camera.

Files:
- face_recognition.py: Main script for face detection and recognition.
- camera.py: Script to open the camera and display the video feed.
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: Pre-trained model for face detection.

Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies: OpenCV.
2. Place the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" file in the "Models" folder.
3. Run the "face_recognition.py" script to start the face recognition system.
